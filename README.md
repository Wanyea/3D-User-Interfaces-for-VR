Some of the 3D User Interfaces for VR projects I am currently working on or have completed!

## VR Haptic Racing 
In this project I constructed a VR haptic steering wheel using an Arduino Uno R3, 12 coin motors, jumper wires, a breadboard and a Hori steering wheel. Most VR racing experiences require you to turn your FOV away from the direction your traveling, increasing chances of cybersickness. The disconnect between visual and vestibular stimuli already contribute to cybersickness but loss of a focal point or spatial awareness negatively contribute as well.
