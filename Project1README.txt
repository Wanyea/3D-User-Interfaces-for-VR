Project 1 README 
Completed by Wanyea Barbel

This project was completed by just me. These were my contributions:

- Designed scene and gathered assets (prefabs, lighting, audio)
- Implemented force abilities using hand tracking and gestures through the use of the InteractionRigOVR (Oculus Integration)
	- Supports shooting lightning, grabbing far away objects and interacting with them, healing yourself
- Worked on enemy/player interactions 
	- Can block enemy attacks and destroy them with a lightsaber
	- Can destroy enemies with force lightning and force power wave. 

What doesn't work:

- I was unable to implement a health system for this experience so currently users can use force abilities without consequence
	- This led to jo "Call force from all Jedi"
- Enemies aren't as random as preferred
	- This led to no "see into the future"
