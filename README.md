Some of the 3D User Interfaces for VR projects I am currently working on or have completed!

## VR Haptic Racing 
In this project I constructed a VR haptic steering wheel using an Arduino Uno R3, 12 coin motors, jumper wires, a breadboard and a Hori steering wheel. Most VR racing experiences require you to turn your FOV away from the direction your traveling, increasing chances of [cybersickness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_sickness#:~:text=A%20major%20trigger%20of%20virtual,are%20sending%20to%20the%20brain.). The disconnect between visual and vestibular stimuli already contribute to cybersickness but loss of a focal point or spatial awareness negatively contribute as well. 

To migigate this, I created a haptic steering wheel that aims to inform users of other vehicles in their cardinal and ordinal directions. This is achieved by sending a vibration to the respective part of the steering relative to where other vehicles are located in the scene. The steering wheel also uses the vibration as a psuedo-haptic technique to simulate the feeling of driving on varying terrains. Using my system, users can have a stronger sense of presense while also understanding the space around them. 

In future work I plan to extrapolate this concept to more interactive experiences that give users feedback in ways that aren't traditionally possible with just a head mounted display alone. Additionally, I plan to test other mediums to apply psuedo-haptic techniques on in order to create more immersive experiences.
